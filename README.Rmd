The goal of `tiktokr` is to provide a scraper for the video-sharing social networking service [TikTok](http://tiktok.com/). 

While writing this library, we were broadly inspired by the Python module [davidteather/TikTok-Api](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api). You will need Python 3.6 or higher to use `tiktokr`.

*Many thanks go to [Vivien Fabry](https://twitter.com/ViviFabrien) for creating the hexagon logo.*

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval = F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("benjaminguinaudeau/tiktokr")
```

Load library

```{r example}
library(tiktokr)

```

Make sure to use your preferred Python installation

```{r}
library(reticulate)

use_python(py_config()$python)

```

Install necessary Python libraries

```{r, eval = F}
tk_install()
```


## Authentification

In November 2020, Tiktok increased its security protocol. They now frequently show a captcha, which is easily triggered after a few requests. This can be solved by specifying the cookie parameter. To get a cookie session: 

1. Open a browser and go to "http://tiktok.com"
2. Scroll down a bit, to ensure, that you don't get any captcha
3. Open the javascript console (in Chrome: View > Developer > Javascript Console)
4. Run `document.cookie` in the console. Copy the entire output (your cookie). 
5. Run `tk_auth()` in R and paste the cookie.

Click on image below for screen recording of how to get your TikTok cookie:

The `tk_auth` function will save cookies (and user agent) as environment variable to your `.Renviron` file. You need to only run this once to use `tiktokr` or whenever you want to update your cookie/user agent.

```{r, eval = F}

tk_auth(cookie = "<paste here the output from document.cookie>")

```

## Examples


For every session involving `tiktokr`, you will need to initialize. Once it is initiliazed you can run as many queries as you want. 

```{r}
tk_init()
```


### Get TikTok trends

Returns a tibble with trends.

```{r, eval = F}
# Trend
trends <- tk_posts(scope = "trends", n = 200)

```


### Get TikToks from User

```{r, eval = F}
user_posts <- tk_posts(scope = "user", query = "willsmith", n = 50) 

```


### Get TikToks from hashtag

Note: Hashtags query only provides 2k hits, which are not drawn randomly or based on the most recent post date but rather **some mix of recent and popular** TikToks.

```{r, eval = F}

hash_post <- tk_posts(scope = "hashtag", query = "maincharacter", n = 100) 

```

### Get TikToks from music id

Note: Hashtags query only provides 2k hits, which are not drawn randomly or based on the most recent post date but rather **some mix of recent and popular** TikToks.

```{r, eval = F}

user_posts <- tk_posts(scope = "user", query = "willsmith", n = 50)
music_post <- tk_posts(scope = "music", query = user_posts$music_id[1], n = 100)

```

### Download TikTok Videos

With `tk_dwnl` you can download videos from TikTok.

From Trends:

```{r, eval = F}
# fs::dir_create("video")
trends <- tk_posts(scope = "trends", n = 5)

trends %>%
  split(1:nrow(.)) %>%
  purrr::walk(~{tk_dwnl(.x$video_downloadAddr, paste0("video/", .x$id, ".mp4"))})
# fs::dir_delete("video")
```
