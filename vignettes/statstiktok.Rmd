```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  message = F,
  warning = F
)

options(scipen = 999)
```

First, let's load `tiktokr` and some `tidyverse` libraries.

```{r, setup, eval = T}
library(tiktokr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
```


Make sure to use your preferred Python installation

```{r, eval = F}
library(reticulate)

use_python(py_config()$python)

```

The next two steps you only need to do once:

1. Install necessary Python libraries

```{r, eval = F}
tk_install()
```

2. Authentication

In November 2020, Tiktok increased its security protocol. They now frequently show a captcha, which is easily triggered after a few requests. This can be solved by specifying the cookie parameter. To get a cookie session: 

1. Open a browser and go to "http://tiktok.com"
2. Scroll down a bit, to ensure, that you don't get any captcha
3. Open the javascript console (in Chrome: View > Developer > Javascript Console)
4. Run `document.cookie` in the console. Copy the entire output (your cookie). 
5. Run `tk_auth()` in R and paste the cookie.

Click on image below for screen recording of how to get your TikTok cookie:

[<img src="https://github.com/benjaminguinaudeau/tiktokr/raw/master/data/preview.png" width="100%">](https://youtu.be/kYMV2ugxacs)

The `tk_auth` function will save cookies (and user agent) as environment variable to your `.Renviron` file. You need to only run this once to use the `tiktokr` or whenever you want to update your cookie/user agent.

```{r, eval = F}
tk_auth(cookie = "<paste here the output from document.cookie>")

```

## Getting #statstiktok posts 

Once per script you need to run `tk_init` to initialize `tiktokr`


```{r, eval = F}
tk_init()
```


```{r, eval = F}
stats_tiktok <- tk_posts(scope = "hashtag", query = "statstiktok", n = 2000)

```

```{r, echo =FALSE}
load('../data/stats_tiktok.rda')

```

Great! Now we have a dataset with metadata on tiktoks mentioning the hashtag 'statstiktok'!

```{r}
glimpse(stats_tiktok)
```

First, the data needs to be cleaned. Many varaibles are irrelevant and useless, so we focus on the most important ones and clean the variablesnames using `janitor::clean_names()`. 

```{r}
stats_tk <- stats_tiktok %>% 
  select(id, createTime, 
         author_id:author_nickname, 
         author_signature, author_avatarLarger, 
         desc, music_id:authorStats_heart) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  distinct(id, .keep_all = T)

glimpse(stats_tk)
```

## Stats about tiktokers

Let`s first find out who are the top posters in the data. [Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti](https://twitter.com/ChelseaParlett) is the most prolific poster, when it comes to #statstiktok. This actually makes sense, considering that she is one of the pioeneers of #statstiktok.

```{r}
stats_tk %>% 
  count(author_unique_id, sort = T) %>% 
  filter(n >= 2) %>% 
  mutate(authr_url = paste0("https://www.tiktok.com/@", author_unique_id)) %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

Metadata include authors data, such as the handle of the author, its description and its stats. The name of the variable makes author metadata easy to retrieve. In addition to classical social media metrics (number of followers, following, posts, likes), Tiktok also proposes a new metric 'digg'. There is no much documention on this, but it seems to be a summary of the current popularity of a user/post. 

```{r}
tiktokers <- stats_tk %>% 
  select(contains("author")) %>% 
  add_count(author_unique_id, name = "vids_in_sample") %>% 
  distinct(author_id, .keep_all = T)

glimpse(tiktokers)
```

### Any famous tiktoker using Stats Tiktok?


```{r}
tiktokers %>% 
  select(author_unique_id, contains("count")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(author_stats_following_count)) %>% 
  rename_all(stringr::str_remove_all, "(author_stats_)|(_count)") %>%
  arrange(desc(follower)) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  mutate(authr_url = paste0("https://www.tiktok.com/@", author_unique_id)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()  %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

Some of the tiktokers, that used at least once #statstiktok seem to be pretty successfull. There is here no doubt, that their post mentioning #statstik has been strongly driving their success. You can also see here the strangeness of this digg count. It seems somehow uncorrelated to the other metrics. 

## Posts over time

When looking at the distribution over time, we see unregular increase, but there is a steady increase in the number of tiktoks mentioning #statstiktok. 

```{r, fig.width = 6}
stats_tk %>% 
  mutate(create_date = from_unix(create_time) %>% lubridate::floor_date("day")) %>% 
  count(create_date) %>% 
  mutate(cumsum_n = cumsum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(create_date, cumsum_n)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%B %Y")  +
  labs(y = "Number of Posts", x = "")
```

## TikToks description

Each tiktok is usually accompanied with a brief text description, which eventually uses hashtasg. Unsurprinsgly, stats-related hashtags are used. We can now use these new hashtags to explore furthermore tiktoks on stats. 

```{r}

stats_tiktok %>%
  select(desc) %>%
  mutate(hashtags = stringr::str_extract_all(desc, "#\\w+")) %>%
  tidyr::unnest(hashtags) %>%
  count(hashtags, sort = T) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>%
  knitr::kable()  %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

```

## Expanding the data using hashtags

```{r, eval = F}

larger_stats_tiktok <- c("statsTikTok", "statistics", "rstats", "datascience") %>%
  purrr::map_dfr(~tk_posts("hashtag", .x, n = 2000)) %>%
  bind_rows(stats_tiktok) %>% # bind_rows the #statstiktok data
  distinct(id, .keep_all = T)

```

```{r, echo = F}
load('../data/larger_stats_tiktok.rda')
```

Using the hashtags with discovered earlier, we can now get data for other hashtags (statsTikTok, statistics, rstats, datascience). We obtain metadata on 3474 tiktoks, which can be further analyzed or used for further expansion. 

```{r}
larger_stats_tk <- larger_stats_tiktok %>% 
  select(id, createTime, 
         author_id:author_nickname, 
         author_signature, author_avatarLarger, 
         desc, music_id:authorStats_heart) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  distinct(id, .keep_all = T)

glimpse(larger_stats_tk)
```

Before closing up, we take a look at the popularity of the considered hashtags. To do so, we filter the 6 queried hashtags and look at the distributions of plays depending on the hashtag. We find out that - in our small and not-at-all random sample -, #statistics is associated with the most viewed, while #rstats is (for now) the least popular hashtag. 

```{r}
larger_stats_tk %>%
  select(desc, matches("^stats")) %>%
  mutate(hashtags = stringr::str_extract_all(desc, "#\\w+")) %>%
  tidyr::unnest(hashtags) %>%
  filter(hashtags %in% c("#statsTikTok", "#statstiktok", "#statistics", "#rstats", "#datascience")) %>%
  mutate(hashtags = forcats::fct_reorder(hashtags, stats_play_count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hashtags, y = stats_play_count)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ylim(c(0, 12e3)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Hashtag", y = "Number of Plays")
```
